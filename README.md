I need a Light Class that I can use to create Light Objects that will create a Light on a web page. My team don't know CSS that well. The Light should be able to switched on, off or blink when a button is pressed on a web page. I want to be able to specify the color of the light. I would like to be able to create multiple light on a web page.
